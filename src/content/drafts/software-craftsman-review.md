I've read "The Software Craftsman" by Sandro Mancuso and  took notes for each chapter. I'll now share the notes on this blog.

## Heroes, Goodwill and Professionalism
This chapter about changing the culture of "heroic efforts" and pulling all-nighters resonated very much with me. In my work as a freelance software engineer I was often in the situation where I should have said "no" to my clients or should have nipped in the bud negotiations over unrealistic deadlines and features. This chapter makes clear, that programmers that regularly overexert themselves over deadlines will burn out, which is not very professional. And it gives a way out of the negativity trap: Instead of just saying "no" and feeling like a failure, give options and describe the different ways forward.

## Working Software
This chapter is largely about how to convince people that best practices like refactoring and test driven development are good ideas. That the "working software" criterion from the agile manifesto is not enough. Test driven development and refactoring must be part of all tasks and not "extra tasks" on the task boards, because as separate tasks they will be inevitably questioned and deleted and nobody wants to do them. Time constraints are not a good argument for ignoring tests and refactoring, because if code is not tested and easily refactored, you are getting into technical debt - "debt" on the future time of your fellow developers.

## Technical Practices
This chapter expands the list of best practices mentioned earlier with a more detailed list of Extreme Programming (XP) practices and explains the benefit of each. It distinguishes between "doing the right thing" - producing working software - and "doing the thing right" - following best practices to produce not only working but also maintainable software that can be tested and deployed with the push of a button.
