Describe oh-my-fish
Essential oh-my-fish plugins: peco-history

TODO
- emacs key config
- 

Plus:
- autocomplete preview
- easy VI key bindings and editing (and status indication) out of the box.
- pretty, informative prompt
Minus:
- have to configure my prompt, existing prompts don' t cut it
- I'm used to emacs bindings for cursor movement
- some docker commands in scripts that use `$(pwd)` instead of `(pwd)` fail.
