- I worked on the prototype of advanced search feature
- Docker environment vs vagrant environment (met at least 2 other people who thought the Vagrant env was horrible). Link to Adams solution. Link to nginx proxy & explain what it does. Wish for general mechanism of network naming/access for dev environments.
- Learned OOJS
    - Thanks to Moriel Schottlander
    - Link to her Todo list tutorial
    - General impressions (ok to work with, tutorial documentation needs work, moving target, very MediaWiki-Specific, no framework, but more of an UI/component library, OO features very much "bolted on" and easy to bungle up (forgetting to call parent constructor/mixin constructor, forgetting to call OO mixin method)) Event Emitter useful. Not "Reactive", no virtual DOM fancyness. accessibility and LTR features builtin.
