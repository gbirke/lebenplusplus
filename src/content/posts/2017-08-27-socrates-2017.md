Personal Kanban: Probably not for me, I'm not a multitasker anyway.
Fiasco and drama: Fehlerkultur, needs and happiness
Mob programming rpg: better distribution of roles, clearer structure for mob programming. TODO read rules
Code Retreat - understanding the domain, study the effects of constraints (silence, time pressure, no return values) on the code style. Astonishing how many implementations you can get: functional or oop, with and without primitives, 2-dimensional vs 1-dimensional grid storage, etc.

Fish shell: still struggling, but determined to try for 2 weeks.
Plus:
- autocomplete preview
- easy VI key bindings and editing (and status indication) out of the box.
Minus:
- have to configure my prompt or tinker with budspencer.
- Have to add cmd-r alternative (peco history)
