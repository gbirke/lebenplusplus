In this article you'll learn what an agile retrospective is and the basic
principles of Non-Violent Communication (NVC), using agile retrospectives as an
example. If you're already familiar with agile retrospectives, you can
skip the sections explaining it.

## What is an agile retrospective?

An agile retrospective is a special meeting format, commonly used in
software development, but also suitable for teams outside of software
development. Its main purpose is the continuous improvement
([Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)) of processes,
collaboration and work itself. Other benefits are knowledge sharing and
building trust and community.

The team holds retrospective in regular intervals (e.g. bi-weekly, monthly,
quarterly, etc), evaluating the past interval, how things improved
compared to the last previous interval and figures out actions for
improving the next interval.

## What does an agile retrospective look like?

Side note: There are many variations of the format, I'll describe the
format that I like best. You can even go "meta" and apply the format to
itself to talk about how you would improve and change the retrospective
format.

A retrospective has the following phases: Brainstorming, Prioritizing, Discussion and Review.

### Brainstorming
The moderator presents the retrospective questions. Typical questions are

* What went well?
* What didn't go so well?
* What have I learned?
* What still puzzles me?

Another set of questions could be 

* What should we keep doing?
* What should we add?
* What should we do less?
* What should we do more?

Or 

* What were the *anchors*? (Things dragging us down)
* What were the *engines*? (Things propelling us forward)

All participants write down things or events from the retrospective
interval that answer the questions, using sticky notes, a sheet of paper
or retrospective software. The notes should be only a few words. Each
participant working on their own has the benefit of not forming a
consensus too early, reducing the influence of the more vocal people in
the group and getting some output of the more withdrawn personalities.

The participants then gather and present their findings, describing the
word on each of their notes in one or two sentences and assigning each
note to a retrospective question. In bigger groups
there might be time constraints like "max. 2-3 items per person"".

There are several ways for the participants to present the answers to the
questions: Do they want to start with the more positive items, to get into
a joyful celebration of successes that helps dealing with the negative
ones? Do they want to end with the positive items, to "end on a positive
note"? Should each person go through all their notes, to avoid blocks of
negativity? Each method has its benefits and each team will find their own
preferred order. 

When all participants have presented their notes, the group clusters
related topics. Try to avoid clusters that are too abstract like
"Information" or "Process". Instead, try to phrase a problem (or success)
statement.

### Prioritizing

Each participant gets a number of votes they can place on an cluster or
single unclustered issue. Depending on the questions, some questions might
not eligible to be voted on, because they don't produce "actionable"
insight. At the end of the voting process, you'll see which topics are the
most important ones for the participants.

The number of votes influences how focused the outcome will be: Having
fewer votes will probably nudge the participants to vote on topics they
care about. But it also means that they might have the impression
of having not enough influence on the priorities.

The voting should be quick and as anonymous as possible, to avoid
faction-building or "agendas".

### Discussion

Discuss each topic, in the order of importance. The goal of the discussion
of each topic should be to find an "action item" - specific things to do
to improve the situation. Sometimes the underlying cause of an issue
is not clear, so the discussion might also be around *what* the
problem is and *why* it occurs. For more complex topics it might be
beneficial to find the "root cause", e.g. by applying the "[Five
whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys)" technique, but keep in
mind that sometimes [it's better to treat the symptoms or realize that
there is no single
cause](http://reinertsenassociates.com/the-cult-of-the-root-cause/).
You might also dissolve clusters if it turns out that you have
clustered different issues together.

When coming up with action items, make sure that they are "actionable" -
specific steps with measurable results, a due date and a person that's
responsible to carry them out. See [SMART
criteria][1]. Following the
SMART criteria increases the likelihood that someone will take action and
achieve tangible results.

Most retrospectives should take one hour, with the discussion part taking
20-30 minutes. The moderator should remind the participants of the time
constraints if a discussion takes too long and propose an action item like
holding a separate workshop or meeting to investigate the issue.

Due to the time constraints, the team might not discuss some of the items
with a lower priority. This is OK - if the underlying issues persist, the
topics will come up in future retrospectives and get a higher priority.


### Reflection

It's helpful to look at action items as "experiments", small changes to
processes or single actions. In the reflection phase the participants look
at the action items from the last retrospective to see if the action item
changed the issue for the better. If an action item is not done yet,
reflect if it's [SMART][1] enough, if there are better alternatives, if
the issue is still relevant, and if the appointed person is still willing
and/or able to do it. The participants can amend and drop past action
items as needed.

In regular intervals (e.g. every 4 retrospectives ), one participant
should also prepare an in-depth look at more than one past retrospective
for common themes and patterns:

* Are some topics recurring? Then the team might need to look for deeper issues or causes.
* How long does it take to actually "do" an action item?
* How many topics did not fit into the discussion? Did they re-emerge?
	does the team regularly drop topics? 

Some software solutions, e.g. [TeamRetro](https://www.teamretro.com/) put
the reflection phase at the end of the retrospective. I personally prefer
to have the reflection phase at the beginning of the retrospective,
because the "unfinished business" can give input for the brainstorming phase.

## The main concepts of Non-Violent Communication

For me, Non-Violent Communication is primarily a specific way of thinking
and perceiving what motivates people, how conflicts arise, how to solve
those conflicts and be more honest and connected with myself and other
people.

Nonviolent communication means being aware of four key concepts:
Observation, feelings, needs and requests. In the following sections,
we'll have a look at these concepts by looking at them in the context an
agile retrospective. 

The examples assume a friendly, open and honest environment where people
want to collaborate on the issues presented. At the same time, I'm
convinced that even if the environment is not that collaborative, the
concepts of NVC might be helpful to transform it.

### Observation

One of the key distinctions of Non-Violent Communication is between
**observations** and **judgements**. Imagine a brainstorming or reflection phase
that's full of blame and judgements:

* *The project didn't finish because Paula did not do enough*
* *Programming language X is crap*
* *I could not do $actionItem because my boss assigned me too many meetings*
* *We never use $shinyTechnology*
* *The product owner is always changing their mind*

Compare the judgemental sentences with more observational ones:

* *I had three open pull requests that were not reviewed for three days*
* *Implementing a typical scenario of Y needs 20 lines of boilerplate code
	in programming language X, which annoys me because I know other
	programming languages can solve it in 3 lines*
* *I would like have at most 3 hours of meetings per week.*
* *We have not introduced a new technology in the last quarter*
* *We have iterated on four of the last features at least two times. I
	wonder if we can be more effective*

You can see that the sentences are more precise, mentioning observable
quantities. You can also see that most of them are
"[I-messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-message)".


#### For facilitators

The phrasing of the retrospective questions matters, because some
questions invite judgement and some questions inspire creativity and
observation.

I like to replace the question "What didn't go so well?" with "What
would I like to improve?"

I also like the framing with "Anchors" and "Engines" or "Stop/Start/More of/Less of".

One good rule to express to the participants is to avoid naming other people.

#### For participants
* Avoid generalizations ("always", "never", "often", etc.)
* Avoid unspecific comparisons ("too fast/slow", "too many/few", etc.).
	Use specific measurements instead.
* Use I-messages, avoid naming other people

### Feelings

The next key distinction of Nonviolent Communication is between
**feelings** and **thoughts**. Thoughts might look like feelings if they
begin with "I feel ...", but if the words that follow the phrase "I feel
..." have a "subject and perpetrator", then they convey more thought than
feeling:

* *I feel left out*
* *I feel misunderstood*
* *I feel underappreciated*

If other people can dispute a statement that looks like a feeling ("But
I'm including you", "I understood what you said"), then there is a high
chance that it's a thought. Genuine feelings like "*I feel sad*", "I feel
lonely" are hard to dispute.

Expressing your feelings in a workplace environment can feel risky,
because it makes you vulnerable. And in the tech world, it's
still not common to talk about feelings and some people might even judge 
it as "unprofessional". But even if you're in an environment where you
can't talk about feelings, applying the NVC mindset and examining your
feelings, distinguishing between feelings and thoughts, will help you to
avoid conflicts and get a better connection to yourself.

In the collection phase, while writing down your sentences, ask yourself,
how you felt in the situation you're describing. Have look at a list of
feelings, to get an idea of what you might feel.

Trust your gut feelings when voting, to see which issues you feel strongly
about.

Notes/todo


The voting process shows that our needs can have different priorities. If
we listen to our instincts and feelings, we get a measurement of how
strong we care about a subject.

The voting process also shows the distinction between thoughts and
feelings: You will get a better and more honest outcome if everyone votes
on topics they feel strongly about and not voting "tactically" where you
assume others will vote too or even to support someone's agenda.

A retro, like NVC, is also about connection. Sometimes an action/request
is not necessary and the mere fact of being heard, seen and accepted is
enough to let an issue rest for a while.


Action items are requests - if they don't get done, there are other needs
that get in the way and can be discussed to find a better strategy/action
items that suits more needs


Ask questions/exercises at the bottom of each NVC topic.
