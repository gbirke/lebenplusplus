In this article you'll learn what an agile retrospective is, the basic
principles of Non-Violent Communication (NVC) and how applying those
principles to a retrospective can improve the retrospective.

If you're already familiar with agile retrospectives, you can
skip the sections explaining it.

## What is an agile retrospective?

An agile retrospective is a special meeting format, commonly used in
software development, but also suitable for teams outside of software
development. Its main purpose is the continuous improvement
([Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)) of processes,
collaboration and work itself. Other benefits are knowledge sharing and
building trust and community inside the team.

The team holds retrospective in regular intervals (e.g. bi-weekly, monthly,
quarterly, etc), evaluating the past interval, how things improved
compared to the last previous interval and figures out actions for
improving the next interval.

## What does an agile retrospective look like?

Side note: There are many variations of the format, I'll describe the
format that I like best. You can even go "meta" and apply the format to
itself to talk about how you would improve and change the retrospective
format.

The meeting should have a **facilitator** who explains the purpose and
format of the meeting, keeps an eye on the clock and the talking time of
the participants and maybe also takes notes. Ideally, the facilitator is
not an active participant. The facilitator guides the meeting through the
following phases: Brainstorming, Prioritizing, Discussion and Review.

### Brainstorming

The facilitator presents the retrospective questions that should focus the
attention to certain areas for the time span since the last retrospective.
Typical questions are

* What went well?
* What didn't go so well?
* What have I learned?
* What still puzzles me?

Another set of questions could be

* What should we keep doing?
* What should we add?
* What should we do less?
* What should we do more?

Or

* What were the *anchors*? (Things dragging us down)
* What were the *engines*? (Things propelling us forward)

All participants write down things or events from the retrospective
interval that answer the questions, using sticky notes, a sheet of paper
or retrospective software. The notes should be only a few words. Each
participant working on their own has the benefit of not forming a
consensus too early, reducing the influence of the more vocal people in
the group and getting input from more withdrawn personalities.

The participants then gather and present their findings, describing the
word on each of their notes in one or two sentences and assigning each
note to a retrospective question. In bigger groups
there might be time constraints like "max. 2-3 items per person"".

There are several ways for the participants to present the answers to the
questions: Do they want to start with the more positive items, to get into
a joyful celebration of successes that helps dealing with the negative
ones? Do they want to end with the positive items, to "end on a positive
note"? Should each person go through all their notes, to avoid blocks of
negativity? Each method has its benefits and each team will find their own
preferred order.

When all participants have presented their notes, the group clusters
related topics. Try to avoid clusters that are too abstract like
"Information" or "Process". Instead, try to phrase a problem (or success)
statement.

### Prioritizing

Each participant gets a number of votes they can place on an cluster or
a single note. Depending on the questions, some questions might
not eligible to be voted on, because they don't produce "actionable"
insight. At the end of the voting process, you'll see which topics are the
most important ones for the participants.

The number of votes influences how focused the outcome will be: Having
fewer votes will probably nudge the participants to vote on topics they
care about. But it also means that they might have the impression
of having not enough influence on the priorities.

The voting should be quick and as anonymous as possible, to avoid
faction-building or "agendas".

### Discussion

Discuss each topic, in the order of importance. The goal of the discussion
of each topic should be to find an "action item" - specific things to do
to improve the situation. Sometimes the underlying cause of an issue
is not clear, so the discussion might also be around *what* the
problem is and *why* it occurs. For more complex topics it might be
beneficial to find the "root cause", e.g. by applying the "[Five
whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys)" technique, but keep in
mind that sometimes [it's better to treat the symptoms or realize that
there is no single
cause](http://reinertsenassociates.com/the-cult-of-the-root-cause/).
You might also dissolve clusters if it turns out that you have
clustered different issues together.

When coming up with action items, make sure that they are "actionable" -
specific steps with measurable results, a due date and a person that's
responsible to carry them out. See [SMART criteria][1]. Following the
SMART criteria increases the likelihood that someone will take action and
achieve tangible results.

Most retrospectives should take one hour, with the discussion part taking
20-30 minutes. The moderator should remind the participants of the time
constraints if a discussion takes too long and propose an action item like
holding a separate workshop or meeting to investigate the issue.

Due to the time constraints, the team might not discuss some of the items
with a lower priority. This is OK - if the underlying issues persist, the
topics will come up in future retrospectives and get a higher priority.


### Reflection

It's helpful to look at action items as "experiments", small changes to
processes or single actions. In the reflection phase the participants look
at the action items from the last retrospective to see if the action item
changed the issue for the better. If an action item is not done yet,
reflect if it's [SMART][1] enough, if there are better alternatives, if
the issue is still relevant, and if the appointed person is still willing
and/or able to do it. The participants can amend and drop past action
items as needed.

In regular intervals (e.g. every 4 retrospectives), one participant
should also prepare an in-depth look at more than one past retrospective
for common themes and patterns:

* Are some topics recurring? Then the team might need to look for deeper issues or causes.
* How long does it take to actually "do" an action item? What could be the
	reason why some action items get done faster than others?
* How many topics did not fit into the discussion? Did they re-emerge?
	Does the team regularly drop topics?

Some software solutions, e.g. [TeamRetro](https://www.teamretro.com/) put
the reflection phase at the end of the retrospective. I personally prefer
to have the reflection phase at the beginning of the retrospective,
because the "unfinished business" can give input for the brainstorming phase.


## The main concepts of Non-Violent Communication

For me, Non-Violent Communication (NVC) is primarily a specific way of thinking
and perceiving what motivates people, how conflicts arise, how to solve
those conflicts and how to be more honest and connected with myself and other
people. It's **not** about "talking friendly" or in a specific way.

Nonviolent Communication means being aware of four key concepts:
Observation, feelings, needs and requests. In the context of NVC, those
concepts have a specific meaning. In the following sections,
we'll have a look at these concepts by looking at them in the context of an
agile retrospective. I'll present each one as a *key distinction*,
contrasting it to an opposite concept.

The examples assume a friendly, open and honest environment where people
want to collaborate on the issues presented. At the same time, I'm
convinced that even if the environment is not that collaborative, the
concepts of NVC might be helpful to transform it. Or at least benefit
yourself and your inner monologue.

### Observation

One of the key distinctions of Non-Violent Communication is between
**observations** and **judgements**. Imagine a brainstorming or reflection phase
that's full of blame and judgements:

* *The project didn't finish because Paula did not do enough*
* *Programming language X is crap*
* *I could not do $actionItem because my boss assigned me too many meetings*
* *We never use $shinyTechnology*
* *The product owner is always changing their mind*

Compare the judgemental sentences with more observational ones:

* *I had three open pull requests that were not reviewed for three days*
* *Implementing a typical scenario of Y needs 20 lines of boilerplate code
	in programming language X, which annoys me because I know other
	programming languages can solve it in 3 lines*
* *I would like have at most 3 hours of meetings per week.*
* *We have not introduced a new technology in the last quarter*
* *We have iterated on four of the last features at least two times. I
	wonder if we can be more effective*

You can see that the sentences are more precise, mentioning observable
quantities. You can also see that most of them are
"[I-messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-message)".


#### For facilitators

The phrasing of the retrospective questions matters, because some
questions invite judgement and some questions inspire creativity and
observation.

I like to replace the question "What didn't go so well?" with "What
would I like to improve?"

I also like the framing with "Anchors" and "Engines" or "Stop/Start/More of/Less of".

One good rule to express to the participants is to avoid naming other people, inviting to use "I-messages".

#### For participants
* Avoid generalizations ("always", "never", "often", "only", etc.)
* Avoid unspecific comparisons ("too fast/slow", "too many/few", etc.).
	Use specific measurements instead.
* Use I-messages, avoid naming other people

### Feelings

The next key distinction of Nonviolent Communication is between
**feelings** and **thoughts**. Thoughts might look like feelings if they
begin with "I feel ...", but if the words that follow the phrase "I feel
..." have a "subject and perpetrator", then they convey more thought than
feeling:

* *I feel left out*
* *I feel misunderstood*
* *I feel underappreciated*

If other people can dispute a statement that looks like a feeling ("But
I'm including you", "I understood what you said"), then there is a high
chance that it's a thought. Genuine feelings like "I feel sad", "I feel
lonely" are hard to dispute.

Expressing your feelings in a workplace environment can feel risky,
because it makes you vulnerable. And in the tech world, it's still not
common to talk about feelings and some people might even judge it as
"unprofessional". But that doesn't mean you don't *have* feelings, only
that you might be not comfortable expressing them at the workplace.
Nonviolent Communication is still useful, because you can *examine* your
feelings. Naming them will help you to get a better understanding of
yourself and a better connection to yourself. Distinguishing between
feelings and thoughts, will help you to avoid conflicts.

Let's look at the examples from the "Observation" section, adding some
feelings:

* *I had three open pull requests that were not reviewed for three days. I
	felt a bit lonely.*
* *I know other programming languages can solve a problem in 3 lines of
	code instead of 20. It's frustrating.*
* *I would like have at most 3 hours of meetings per week. I feel totally
	exhausted and unproductive after a several meetings in a row.*
* *We have not introduced a new technology in the last quarter. I'm afraid
	I miss out important developments.*
* *We have iterated on four of the last features at least two times. I'm
	puzzled why and curious to understand our processes better.*

#### For facilitators

- Encourage participants to share feelings, but don't pressure anyone to
	share feelings (see section "Requests").
- Lead by example by expressing your own feelings.
- When people express "thought-feelings", try to paraphrase them with
	different words, as a question. If you're not prescribing feelings but
	asking in form of a question it doesn't matter if you can guess the "right" words
	or not.

#### For participants

In the collection phase, while writing down your sentences, ask yourself,
how you felt in the situation you're describing. Have look at a list of
feelings, to get an idea of what you might feel.

Trust your gut feelings when voting, to see which issues you feel strongly
about. The voting process also shows the distinction between thoughts and
feelings: You will get a better and more honest outcome if everyone votes
on topics they feel strongly about and not voting "tactically" where you
assume others will vote too or even to support someone's agenda.

Improve Collection and Discussion phase by expressing your feelings (with
examples).

When coming up with action items, check if you're willing to volunteer for
carrying out the action. If you have uncomfortable feelings (e.g. if you
feel hesitant, resistant, "disappointed", sad, angry or doubtful), this
can be an indicator that the action item does not fulfill all your needs
(see next section).


### Needs

Needs are the central element of Nonviolent Communication. The key
distinction for needs is between **needs** and **strategies**. In
Nonviolent Communication needs are *abstract* and sometimes even thought
of as universal to every human being. Strategies are the things that
fulfill needs. For most needs there is more than one strategy to fulfill
it (although most people have a preferred strategy). For example you can
fulfill your need for learning and growth through online courses, books,
talking to expert and colleagues, etc. You can fulfill your need for an
comfortable temperature through clothing, opening the windows, getting a
fan, moving around to get warm or changing the AC settings. From the
temperature example you can see that conflict arise over *strategies*
(e.g. someone opening the window or turning the heating on), while people
can agree on a common shared need (for a comfortable temperature).

If you want to check if something is more of a need or more of a strategy,
check if it involves a specific action, item, time, place or person. If
that's the case, then it's probably not a need in the definition of
Nonviolent Communication. There are many word-lists with needs on the
internet (search for "NVC list of needs"). You can look for those lists to
get an idea what other people consider abstract needs in the definition of
NVC. What you shouldn't do is use those list as a prescriptive tool to
judge other people's language, judging "this is nonviolent and this is
not". Using the lists in this way will turn Nonviolent Communication
principles from a helpful tool for getting connected to other people into
a weapon that'll create conflict.

Similar to the "I feel ..." prefix, the "I need ..." prefix can also
introduce a strategy. Especially the prefix "I need you to ..." is rarely
expressing a need and is often a suggestion for a strategy.

#### For facilitators

When preparing for a retrospective, think of the different roles in a
team: product owner, developer, UX person, architect, etc). Each role can
have "recurring" needs that come from their tasks and interactions with
other roles. Try to put yourself in the shoes of each role and come up
with a "top 5" list of needs a person with that role might have. Talk to
people in that role and check your assumptions.

Looking at grouped brainstorming notes, check with the participants what
needs are behind the points expressed in the notes. You might find
different needs behind similar notes. This can help "disentangling" notes
that participants grouped together, but don't belong into the same group (or help
later when finding a strategy that fulfills *all* the needs).

Having only one word that represents a need as a group name for similar
brainstorming notes (e.g. "Efficiency", "Structure" or "Harmony") might
not be descriptive enough. Don't try too hard to force everything into a
"Nonviolent Communication Structure", but use NVC as a tool to look
between the lines of the written and spoken words.

Watch out for conflicts over strategies and try to find common ground
after collecting each participants needs, explaining the difference
between needs and strategies.


#### For participants

Keep a word-list of needs and go through the list for
each topic on the board, writing down what fulfilled or unfulfilled needs
might be behind that topic. This is a private exercise that can help you
to get in the "NVC mindset".

When grouping similar notes, check with other participants what the
(un)fulfilled needs are.

If you're unsure about a topic or why someone makes a suggestion, try
asking about the underlying need, offering a suggestion ("Do you want to
do X because you need more Y?"). It doesn't matter if you guessed right or
not, offering needs in the form of a question often has the effect of
helping the other person to express their need.

When you come up with action items, it's helpful to keep the distinction
between strategies and needs in mind: The needs are the reason *why* you
and your colleagues want an action item. The action item should represent
the *who*, *when*, *where* and *what*, the strategy that hopefully will
fulfill the needs. The [SMART criteria][1] for action items go well with
the questions for strategies: Specific (what), Measurable
(what/how/where), Assignable (who), Relevant (why) and Time-Bound (when).

### Requests

Nonviolent Communication distinguishes between *requests* and *demands*,
by looking at the question "Can you say 'no' to the request"? If saying
"no" has repercussions (getting punished, missing out on rewards), then a
request becomes a demand. Saying "no" to a request means that you have needs
that would be left unfulfilled by the request. It's not the end of the
conversation or negotiation, it's the beginning. Although it can seem
trite and manipulative, sometimes the question "What do you need to say
'yes'?" can help to reveal the unfulfilled needs.

Most requests are suggestions for a strategy, but sometimes it's enough to
be heard and seen, sometimes the request is a "connection request", asking
the other person for feedback on what you said, or trying to paraphrase
what they said.

#### For facilitators

Don't assign action items, ask the participants if there is a volunteer.
If no one is volunteering, you can ask what's keeping the participants from
volunteering (after making clear that the action items are voluntary).

Pay attention to action items that don't get done over the course of
more than two or three retrospectives. It's a sign that there are more
pressing needs keeping the volunteer from doing it. Discuss during the
review phase if the action item is still relevant and important to all
participants.


#### For participants

When discussing your notes, ask yourself if you need an action item to
meet the unmet needs behind the note, or if it's enough for you to be
understood and appreciated by your colleagues.

When discussing action items, ask yourself what's keeping you from saying
an enthusiastic "yes" to an item that is up for volunteering.

## Conclusion

TODO How NVC supercharges retrospectives

---
Notes/todo

What is NVC *for*, what are the benefits?

Feelings section: The benefit of vulnerability

Don't let "NVC" get in the way of being honest and open with each other.
When in doubt, or if you're struggling to find "a non-violent way" to say
things, rather say what's on your mind and ask the facilitator or other
participants what feelings and needs they can identify in what you said.

Feelings are an indicator for fulfilled or unfulfilled needs.

Conflicts are on the strategy level - what to do about "conflicting"
needs? When you can't find a strategy that fulfills everyone's needs,
sometimes the solution is "temporal" - negotiating which order you will do
the strategies, fulfilling all needs. This needs some trust in the group,
that your needs matter and will be fulfilled in the end.

What's "Violence"? In the context of NVC it's ignoring needs (our own or
others).

Ask questions/exercises at the bottom of each NVC topic.

Add  examples of thought- and feeling-sentences at the end of the
"Feelings" section

Maybe change temperature example in "Needs" section to something less
subjective.
