I've migrated this blog from Drupal 6 to the static site generator [Spress](http://spress.yosymfony.com/). As a developer I work best with version-controlled plain text files and in the sure knowledge that my "CMS" is not reachable from the internet.

I've dropped three heavily outdated posts in the process. The URLs of the old blog never worked right (since I had mixed language content), so felt no need to keep them.

The design is a stand-in until I have the time to do something better. Judging by the post frequency that'll be in 2036 ;-)

Will I write more? Probably not. Will I enjoy writing more when I do it? You bet.
