This is a 5-minute lightning talk I gave at the "Write The Docs Europe" conference in Prague.

![Santas little helper](/assets/images/posts/lightning_talk/box-christmas-claus-cute-41940.jpeg) I work at Wikimedia Germany in team that is tasked with improving the Wikipedia and its sister projects, together with the community of authors and readers. We have a process where we gather the wishes form

## Team of Product manager, community manager, developers

## All need the skills of technical writers to some extent
* Speaking the right kind of language, both towards non-technical community members and also towards developers
* Understanding of the "product" (Wikipedia in our case), its features and its inner workings
* Listening to what their audience is saying

## How do we work?
* Gathering the wishes
* Voting on "Most wanted" wishes, getting priorities
* Working on the solutions to the wishes in sprints.
* Iterate solutions with prototypes and continued improvement

## "If I asked my customers what they wanted, they'd have said a faster horse" - Not Henry Ford
* Combine empathy and technical knowledge to find out what's behind user's wishes. Sometimes the actual development is quite different from what was wished - in a good way!
* Documentation of the evolution of the wish - discussions on the wiki, Commit logs in versions control, issue tracker and blog posts about the development.

## Conclusion
* Core communication skills of tech writers are needed when doing this kind of "community-driven product development"
